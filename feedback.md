1. I’m surprised that you didn’t really include any of the literature on rapid appearance-based trait inferences, and specifically competence and threat/dominance (stuff by Todorov and colleagues, for example). I would recommend thinking about incorporating this literature into your lit review, as reviewers who do work on physical appearance will likely be expecting it. Also since most of the findings in this literature have been around "looking  competent," you might get questions about how competence, specifically, might factor into your story and whether looking more upper-class is about looking more competent, so I’d give that some thought.  
There is also a small but growing literature on the importance of gender typicality of facial features and how that matters (work by Colleen Carpinella, for example). You may want to include some of that, as well, since you have a gender component in your analysis. 
And actually, since gender is ultimately such a big part of your story, I think it would be helpful to spend more time more fully incorporating it into your theory and lit review—why would you expect effects to vary by gender? Is it sort of an additive effect of looking working-class and also being female that doubly-disadvantages them? Or is it something else—something about the specific combination of being female and working class? You might want to look into role congruency theory (Eagly and Karau 2002), as this may help you think about the framing.  

2. Are there clues in the literature about what aspects of physical appearance lead one to look more “upper-class” or “lower-class?” Determining what these are is beyond the scope of your paper, but I know from my work in this area that reviewers often will ask about the specific elements of appearance that signal something (in my case, competence; in your case, status).   

3. Did you collect respondent-level data on those who took the survey and can you provide descriptive sample statistics for those who actually responded? I know that you sent the survey to a random sample, but what did the sample of those who actually took the survey look like? 

4. Also, I wondered why you look specifically at appearance-occupation congruence, as opposed to just asking people what social class they think a candidate looks like they belong to. Theoretically, someone could look upper class but not be, e.g. and it seems like it’s the voter’s perception of their status per se that’s important, rather than the perception of how well their appearance matches their actual status. At least, that is what I gather from how the paper is framed. I don’t think this is a problem, but I think it would be good to have a discussion about why you made this design choice. 
 
5. Did you do anything with the masculinity/femininity ratings? Again, given the gender typicality literature I mentioned before, there could be something interesting there.

1. First and most importantly (since the term is in the title), your meaning of the word “turnout” is different from how it is conventionally understood in the discipline.  “Turnout” refers to the percentage of some electorate that voted in a particular election. Turnout was 66.8% in the 2020 US presidential election, and 68.7% in the 2019 parliamentary elections in Finland. You are talking about the number of votes each of your various candidates received in the election at hand.

2. As a non-expert, I do not understand how the election you are studying actually worked. Finland has some sort of PR multi-member parliamentary elections, but I do not understand party lists. How many votes did each voter cast in the municipal election you are studying? This is important to clarify.  Each individual is a member of a party, correct? Is there more than one candidate from each party running in these elections?

3. I understand the attractiveness, masculinity, and femininity ratings in Table 1, but I am very confused by the occupation-congruent appearance rating. You (and voters) know each candidate’s occupation, correct?  So if Joe Politician reports that his occupation is being a policeman, say, is the question “How much does this person look like a policeman?”  Or is the question “How much does this person look like a working-class person”?

4. Working class and upper class are the two extremes of your social class measure, so we know the perceived direction of those candidates who do not look like their class. But what about a middle class candidate who does not look like she is middle class. Do you know if the person looks more working class or upper class?  Does it matter?

5. Table 2, and Figures 2 and 3, are too damn small to see anything!  

6. You start the paper by talking about the importance of physical attractiveness as a heuristic. To go to a lot of effort to measure it, but then your primary analyses – models 1, 2, and 3 – ignore it. That was confusing to me, and you come back to talking about the effects of perceived attractiveness. I would have had the main model include the effects of candidate occupation (class), attractiveness, physical occupation congruence, and the interactions between class and congruence. 

7. On average, were upper-class candidates perceived to be more attractive than lower class candidates? If you reported this, I missed it, but it is not only interesting, but pretty important in the interpretation of your results.

8. I do not understand the heuristic value of physical occupation congruence, however, and this is crucial to your research. If you did not know the actual occupation of a candidate, this would be tremendously important information. But voters already know each candidate’s occupation, so what additional information does congruence provide?  Is congruence basically just doubling-down on the effect of social class? I suspect instead that it is appearance incongruence that is the most important perception.

9. You need to put the number of votes received by the various candidates in perspective. 154?  99?  These numbers sound very small to me.  Is that all it takes to get elected to one of these positions?

10. In the US, as you know, party affiliation is by far the most important political heuristic.  You say you included party in your analyses; how, and what was its effects. I can’t believe that attractiveness and occupation-appearance congruence are more important than party in determining voting behavior.  If so, it make Finnish voters sound pretty shallow to me.

11. I want to know the relative importance of party, appearance, social class, congruence, and the interaction, in determining how many votes each candidate received – overall, and then separately for male and female candidates.  Can you show us that, somehow?
