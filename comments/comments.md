This is a nice paper reporting interesting results. Overall I like it, although I do have some concerns/suggestions. So I'm not going to focus on the good parts very much, but instead on thoughts about strengthening and clarifying some things. The study design seems good to me, and the results are really interesting, and in some ways, I supposed, a bit depressing if people use appearance to infer things that they probably should not. I do think the connection between appearance and social status with respect to voting is a really innovative contribution.
 
Probably my top issue with the paper is a very simple one to fix. I don't think you care clear enough about what your dependent variable really is.  Is this about TURNOUT or the DIRECTION of the vote? Right in the second paragraph you use both “voting” and “turnout” interchangeably. In some sense they can be used this way, but I found myself very unclear as I got further into the paper as to whether you were writing about turnout effects – increasing or decreasing the likelihood of someone voting - or effects on the direction of the vote – increasing or reducing the vote received by candidates. So you should make sure the paper is very clear on this.
 
Having said this, I do not necessarily follow how your theory would lead to differential “turnout” as shown on the model on page 2. Why should congruency on occupation status and physical appearance have any impact on whether people show up to vote? I can see why it would impact the direction of the vote – that is, whether a candidate gets more or fewer votes, but not whether people turn out in the first place. In the end, of course, you actually seem to mean the direction of the vote, NOT turnout, based on your data description at the bottom of the same page. So you need to fix the figure as well as your language on this point.
 
In reading the theory section in the first few pages, I did wonder if there would be other confounds with your status X appearance model in the data you have. In particular, it STATUS related to PARTY in Finland – that is, are some parties made up primarily of lower status people and others of higher status? The same thing with ideology – in the US I would argue that conservatives are more likely to also be higher status people in terms of their occupations. I don't know if that’s true, but it seems potentially likely to me. You should address this potential confound early, so your readers don't wonder about confounds. I also wonder about the party lists and gender – are some parties much more female than others? What does this do to your study if so? You should address this possibility.  I suppose Figure 2 helps with this in that it mostly shows similar distributions of “beauty” across parties. But I am not sure it is as even as you suggest. The third graph in each row (by party) shows a lot of heterogeneity across parties, it seems to me., particularly in masculinity and femininity, but also somewhat on attractiveness. I think you need to at least talk about this.
 
How does the party frequency in your dataset (Footnote 13) compare to party distribution in real life – do you have an appropriate representation of each party? 
 
I'm not sure why you estimate your results on men and women separately rather than using gender as an interaction term in a full model with all the data. Splitting the groups with separate analyses may results in slightly different results. 
 
Where you begin to write about your results, I find myself puzzled at the numbers you cite – probably because I know nothing about Finland. These seem like very small numbers – predicted vote counts for males of 45 and 48 votes versus females at 154 and 99 votes confused me. I guess there are just not that many votes cast? Help the reader make sense of this. At the same time, the very small numbers for men suggest to me you may have a floor effect – that is, you find little happening with men because the vote counts are so low already, they can't get much lower. I don't know if that is true of course, but wanted to note the possibility. And maybe males benefit more from attractiveness because they start at a much lower point in terms of vote received? Again, something to at least consider, even if you decide I'm wrong about this. 
 
Make your tables readable – they are too small to read the numbers and on your figures (like figure 3) you need to label the y-axis correctly. It is NOT “candidate turnout” given the correct use of the word “turnout”. It is the vote received. Also, my own preference is to make y-axes match when you are including multiple charts in the same figure. It facilitates comparison. When the values of the axes are very different, it is hard to properly compare and may overstate one result versus another. 
 
I would like to know how much of the change in votes received is due to occupation and how much due to beauty. You should probably talk about these main effects somewhere, even though your focus is on the interaction (congruence) between the two.
 
Explain why you did not include voters 65 years and older as candidate appearance raters? I don't see a justification for this and I wonder what it might even be.
 
The literature review on heuristics and attraction strikes me as particularly good. Nice job! While not directly about heuristics, I will point you to a chapter in Feeling Politics where Rick Lau and I examined whether physical attractiveness was more important than policy positions in a (mock) presidential primary. I’ve attached the chapter to this email. The citation is: 
 
Redlawsk, David P and Richard R. Lau (2006). I like Him, but…: Vote Choice when Candidate Likeability and Closeness of Issues Clash. In Redlawsk, David P. (Ed). Feeling Politics: Emotion in Political Information Processing (pp 187-208.) Palgrave Macmillan. 
 
This may or may not be useful to you.
 

(pages aren’t numbered so it is hard to identify locations…)  On the page with the heading “Empirical Analyses and Results) there is a typo in the paragraph above, where it reads “are different for women and women.” I assume it should be “women and men.” 
 
 
Overall, as I noted, I like the paper and the study is well thought out – my critiques are not major, and I think pretty easily addressed for the most part.

have a few questions/comments for you below (in no particular order). Feel free to follow up if any of this doesn’t make sense or you want to chat further. 
 
I’m surprised that you didn’t really include any of the literature on rapid appearance-based trait inferences, and specifically competence and threat/dominance (stuff by Todorov and colleagues, for example). I would recommend thinking about incorporating this literature into your lit review, as reviewers who do work on physical appearance will likely be expecting it. Also since most of the findings in this literature have been around "looking  competent," you might get questions about how competence, specifically, might factor into your story and whether looking more upper-class is about looking more competent, so I’d give that some thought.  
There is also a small but growing literature on the importance of gender typicality of facial features and how that matters (work by Colleen Carpinella, for example). You may want to include some of that, as well, since you have a gender component in your analysis. 
And actually, since gender is ultimately such a big part of your story, I think it would be helpful to spend more time more fully incorporating it into your theory and lit review—why would you expect effects to vary by gender? Is it sort of an additive effect of looking working-class and also being female that doubly-disadvantages them? Or is it something else—something about the specific combination of being female and working class? You might want to look into role congruency theory (Eagly and Karau 2002), as this may help you think about the framing.  

Are there clues in the literature about what aspects of physical appearance lead one to look more “upper-class” or “lower-class?” Determining what these are is beyond the scope of your paper, but I know from my work in this area that reviewers often will ask about the specific elements of appearance that signal something (in my case, competence; in your case, status).   

Did you collect respondent-level data on those who took the survey and can you provide descriptive sample statistics for those who actually responded? I know that you sent the survey to a random sample, but what did the sample of those who actually took the survey look like? 

Also, I wondered why you look specifically at appearance-occupation congruence, as opposed to just asking people what social class they think a candidate looks like they belong to. Theoretically, someone could look upper class but not be, e.g. and it seems like it’s the voter’s perception of their status per se that’s important, rather than the perception of how well their appearance matches their actual status. At least, that is what I gather from how the paper is framed. I don’t think this is a problem, but I think it would be good to have a discussion about why you made this design choice. 
 
Did you do anything with the masculinity/femininity ratings? Again, given the gender typicality literature I mentioned before, there could be something interesting there. 

I hope this is helpful! Best of luck with the paper and please do let me know where it ends up!

Best wishes,

Review of “Physical Appearance and Turnout in Finnish Elections: An Inequality Perspective”
Hector Bahamonde and Outi Sarpila

Hector, 
	I read your paper and like the research project a lot!  You have a wonderful, and pretty unique, dataset.  I have a couple of relatively minor wording changes and clarifications that I think it is important to address before you send this out, but then some pretty serious confusions that might be specific to me, but that is all I have to go by.  Let me jump right in.

•	First and most importantly (since the term is in the title), your meaning of the word “turnout” is different from how it is conventionally understood in the discipline.  “Turnout” refers to the percentage of some electorate that voted in a particular election. Turnout was 66.8% in the 2020 US presidential election, and 68.7% in the 2019 parliamentary elections in Finland. You are talking about the number of votes each of your various candidates received in the election at hand.

•	As a non-expert, I do not understand how the election you are studying actually worked. Finland has some sort of PR multi-member parliamentary elections, but I do not understand party lists. How many votes did each voter cast in the municipal election you are studying? This is important to clarify.  Each individual is a member of a party, correct? Is there more than one candidate from each party running in these elections?

•	I understand the attractiveness, masculinity, and femininity ratings in Table 1, but I am very confused by the occupation-congruent appearance rating. You (and voters) know each candidate’s occupation, correct?  So if Joe Politician reports that his occupation is being a policeman, say, is the question “How much does this person look like a policeman?”  Or is the question “How much does this person look like a working-class person”?

•	Working class and upper class are the two extremes of your social class measure, so we know the perceived direction of those candidates who do not look like their class. But what about a middle class candidate who does not look like she is middle class. Do you know if the person looks more working class or upper class?  Does it matter?

•	Table 2, and Figures 2 and 3, are too damn small to see anything!  

•	You start the paper by talking about the importance of physical attractiveness as a heuristic. To go to a lot of effort to measure it, but then your primary analyses – models 1, 2, and 3 – ignore it. That was confusing to me, and you come back to talking about the effects of perceived attractiveness. I would have had the main model include the effects of candidate occupation (class), attractiveness, physical occupation congruence, and the interactions between class and congruence. 

•	On average, were upper-class candidates perceived to be more attractive than lower class candidates? If you reported this, I missed it, but it is not only interesting, but pretty important in the interpretation of your results.

•	I do not understand the heuristic value of physical occupation congruence, however, and this is crucial to your research. If you did not know the actual occupation of a candidate, this would be tremendously important information. But voters already know each candidate’s occupation, so what additional information does congruence provide?  Is congruence basically just doubling-down on the effect of social class? I suspect instead that it is appearance incongruence that is the most important perception.

•	You need to put the number of votes received by the various candidates in perspective. 154?  99?  These numbers sound very small to me.  Is that all it takes to get elected to one of these positions?

•	In the US, as you know, party affiliation is by far the most important political heuristic.  You say you included party in your analyses; how, and what was its effects. I can’t believe that attractiveness and occupation-appearance congruence are more important than party in determining voting behavior.  If so, it make Finnish voters sound pretty shallow to me.

•	I want to know the relative importance of party, appearance, social class, congruence, and the interaction, in determining how many votes each candidate received – overall, and then separately for male and female candidates.  Can you show us that, somehow?


I hope this helps!	Rick
