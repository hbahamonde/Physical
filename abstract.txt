There seems to be a consensus that physically attractive individuals earn more and win elections more often. Unfortunately, very little is known about how voters evaluate candidates with socioeconomically unequal “looks.” To bridge this gap, we study the electoral consequences of looking upper-class, middle-class, or working-class for candidates. Using official electoral data for the 2017 Finnish municipal elections and the European Socio-Economic Classification, we classified candidates' occupations. We also constructed a novel dataset based on a representative sample of the Finnish population (N=7,920). The participants rated a subsample of high-quality photographs of political candidates (N=1,415) according to several physical appearance measurements (attractiveness and congruence between physical appearance and occupation). Our analyses suggest that Finnish citizens systematically vote for candidates that show higher degrees of congruence between physical appearance and occupation, particularly candidates that look like they have upper-class occupations and do have them. Furthermore, the data suggest that there exists a systematic electoral penalty, particularly for female candidates that look like they have working-class occupations and do have them.
