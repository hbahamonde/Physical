While the majority of studies have concentrated on economic and electoral effects of physical attractiveness, very little is known about social inequalities related to other aspects of physical appearance. To bridge this gap, in this paper we study the electoral consequences for candidates of looking upper-class, middle-class or working-class. Using official electoral data of the 2017 Finnish municipal elections, and the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC), we classified candidates' occupations. In addition to that, we constructed a novel dataset comprised of a representative sample of the Finnish population (N=7,920). In these data, participants rated a subsample of high-quality photos of political candidates (N=1,412) according to several physical appearance measurements (attractiveness and physical-occupation congruence). Exploiting this novel data, we study the relationship between occupation-congruent appearance and turnout. Our analyses suggest that Finnish citizens systematically vote for candidates that show higher degrees of congruence between physical appearance and occupation, particularly, candidates that look-like and also hold upper-class occupations. Furthermore, the data suggest that there exists a systematic electoral penalty, particularly for female candidates, that look-like and also hold working-class occupations. The implications of our findings for current and future research on physical appearance and social inequalities are discussed.
